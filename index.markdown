# Introduction & Objectives

__Project Motivation__

Genre classification plays a key role in understanding media content. However, due to movies spanning multiple genres, it is challenging to accurately classify them using only one type of data. Relying solely on plot summaries (text) or movie posters (image) can lead to incomplete predictions. We will attempt to combine both modalities, text and image, to capture richer semantic and aesthetic information to hopefully improve performance and have better movie genre predictions.

__Goals__
- Collect, and prepare a dataset of movie posters and plot summaries for our models
- Investigate and train image model(s)
- Investigate and train text model(s)
- Fuse the best performing image model with the best performing text model to perform joint classification.
- Evaluate the performance of our unimodal models (text or image) and our multimodal models (text and image)
